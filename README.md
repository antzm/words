## Background information

This web-app is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Usually, the code is separated in diffentt files but for simplicity, the complete code has been included in a single HTML file, where there are sections for the CSS and the JavaScript code.

This has the advantage that the file can be easily edited, used and shared, as it is a single file without any dependencies. If downloaded, it will work without internet connection.

If used through a web-page, an internet connection will only be needed to initially acces the web-app, while after that, there is no need for an internet connection, as the web-app does not access the internet at any point because all the data needed are stored inside the single file.
